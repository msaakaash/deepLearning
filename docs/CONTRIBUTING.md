# Contributing to Deep Learning Repository  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Your contributions help improve the repository and benefit the deep learning community.  

## How Can You Contribute?  
We welcome all kinds of contributions, including but not limited to:  
- Adding new deep learning models or concepts  
- Enhancing documentation or tutorials  
- Fixing bugs  
- Refactoring code for better readability  
- Creating notebooks for new datasets  
- Writing tests or adding evaluation metrics  
- Translating content (e.g., README) into other languages  

## Getting Started  
To contribute, follow these steps:  

### 1. Fork the Repository  
Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the repository to create your own copy.  

### 2. Clone Your Fork  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepLearning.git  
cd deepLearning  
```  
Replace `your-username` with your GitHub handle.  

### 3. Create a New Branch  
```bash  
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  
```  

### 4. Make Your Changes  
- Implement the change or new feature  
- Test your code to ensure it works properly  
- Follow consistent naming conventions and code style  

### 5. Stage and Commit  
```bash  
git add .  
git commit -m "Brief but descriptive commit message"  
```  

### 6. Push to Your Fork  
```bash  
git push origin feature/your-feature-name  
```  

### 7. Open a Pull Request  
Go to your forked repository and click on: **Compare & pull request → Create pull request**  
Be sure to:  
- Give a meaningful title  
- Add a detailed description of the changes  
- Reference related issues if any (e.g., `Closes #12`)  

## Guidelines  
- Ensure the code is readable, well-documented, and follows Pythonic practices  
- Keep pull requests focused—avoid combining unrelated changes  
- If adding a new notebook, follow the format used in existing notebooks  
- Use Markdown syntax for readable documentation  
- Avoid committing large datasets—link to external sources instead  
- Always pull the latest changes from the upstream repository before pushing  

```bash  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/msaakaash/deepLearning.git  
git fetch upstream  
git merge upstream/main  
```
